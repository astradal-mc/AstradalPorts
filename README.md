# AstradalPorts
An immersive, lore-friendly fast travel plugin for PaperMC servers using the Towny plugin. AstradalPorts allows players to create and use special lodestones, called **Portstones**, to teleport between locations, creating a structured and balanced travel network.

## Features

  - **In-World Teleportation:** Players interact directly with Lodestone blocks in the world to travel.
  - **Three Port Types:**
      - üêé **Land Ports:** For travel between towns, limited by distance.
      - üö¢ **Sea Ports:**  Travel affected by time and weather.
      - üõ´ **Airship Ports:** Rare, nation-level ports for long-distance travel.
  - **Deep Towny Integration:** Portstones are owned by towns and nations. Only mayors or nation leaders can manage them, and permissions are handled through Towny ranks.
  - **Vault Economy Support:** Charge configurable travel fees for using a portstone, which are automatically deposited into the destination town's bank.
  - **Dynamic Holograms:** Clean, multi-line holograms display the portstone's name, type, and status (`Enabled`/`Disabled`) in real-time.
  - **Interactive GUI:** Right-clicking a portstone opens a menu of available destinations, filtered by type, range, and status.
  - **Configurable Restrictions:** Set custom cooldowns, warmup timers, and range limits for each port type.
  - **Robust & Performant:** Built with a modern, event-driven architecture and a persistent SQLite database to be efficient and reliable.

## Commands

All commands are rooted under `/portstone` (alias: `/ps`).
